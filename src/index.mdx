# Welcome to Rimble

### Rimble is a set of adaptable components and design standards to help you get your decentralized application (dApps) off the ground, fast.

Within you'll find documentation and design guidelines for most standard UI components plus some that are more specific to decentralized products. Your tech stack and workflow are yours to decide. We impose as few constraints as possible.
